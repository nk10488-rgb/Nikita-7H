Saliba became the first Arsenal outfield player since Lee Dixon in 1989/90 to play every minute of the 2023/24 Premier League season.
He forms a formidable central defensive partnership with Gabriel Magalhães, which has transformed Arsenal into one of the strongest defensive sides in the game.
He recently signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal in September 2025, committing his future to the club until June 2030 amidst interest from other top clubs like Real Madrid.
Saliba is known for his strength, pace, excellent tackling, and composure on the ball. </p>
